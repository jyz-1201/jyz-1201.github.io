I am currently a 2-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University. I obtained my bachelor's degree from the School of Software at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2023.

I am broadly interested in large language models (LLMs) for natural and programming languages. My on-going projects involve application of LLMs on code deobfuscation and 5G specification analysis.

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate. The best way to reach me is via email: jiang (dot) 2896 (at) osu (dot) edu.
